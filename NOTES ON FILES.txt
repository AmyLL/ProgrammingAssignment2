## Notes on Files

There are 4 R Functions submitted:
	1. vectorCache.R
	2. cachemean.R
	3. makeCacheMatrix.R
	4. cacheSolve.R


The functions vectorCache and cachemean work together. VectorCache generates the desired vector and stores it in a cache. The function returns a list of additional functions, one of which calculates the mean of the vector. If the mean of a particular vector has been calculated, this function also stores it's mean. 
Use cachemean to either calculate the mean of the vector created above or to retrieve a previously calculated mean.

The functions makeCacheMatrix and cache Solve work together. MakeCacheMatrix generates the desired matrix and stores it in cache. It also returns a list of functions, one of which solves the matrix (calculates it's inverse) and stores the solution in cache.
Use cacheSolve to either solve the matrix generated previously or retrieve the solution from cache.
